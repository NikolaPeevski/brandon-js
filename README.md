# Brandon CLI

A CLI to manage brands for Ionic projects

## Using Brandon and the initial idea
Brandon is ment to be a project dedicated CLI for managing brands. Currently supporting Ionic in a very early stage.
After running ``` npm i brandonjs --save``` you will need to add the following to your package json
``` node ./node_modules/brandonjs/lib/index.js``` . The reason behind not automating the process is due to unintential malforming of a package json file in a big project.

## TODO

- [ ] Implement dynamic configs for inital setup
- [ ] Implement brand creating by template
- [ ] Fully implement branding CRUD
- [ ] Implement brand verification based on templates and configs
